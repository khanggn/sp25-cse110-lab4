1. values added: 20
2. final result: 20
3. The difference between var and let is that var has no block scope so it will run the code wherever the var variable gets called on. So in the case of the code snip bit, it should've only ran code 9. However since var ignores that structure both the if and else command ran.

5. Line 13 will throw an error since you can't declare let twice in the same scope. 
6. It will give us an error. On line 5, since we declared what const result is already going to be, on line 6 attempts to re-assign the const result so it will throw an error.
7. I think so here it will also give us an an error with the same logic as the previous answer since line 7 tries to reassign result which is a const.
